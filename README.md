# WinBOLT v1.0
# Maintenance Automation Tool | Windows Operating System
###############################################################################################################

I created this tool to simplify my job on the Windows Operating System. The maintenance work more often than not becomes perpetual. My ultimate goal and function of WinBOLT was to automate the standard process. An idea I had lingering for years, although without the proper programming skills it was impossible.

As time progressed, I found using Batch was native to me and with the help of the recent Chocolatey framework only speeded up the process. This morphed into what I envision for WinBOLT's design. Simple, effective and very useful.

I've provided everything needed, except the EEK folder which you will need from Emsisoft's Commandline Scanner.

If this is for personal use you don't have to worry about EEK license.
Comercial users must purchase scans directly from Emsisoft.
